        <h1>Notes</h1>
        <p>
            <span class="gray" id="feb1326">February 13, 2026</span>
            <br>
            On the 28th of December <span class="date">1895</span> in Paris, Cinema was born.
            <br class="short">
            The <span class="name">Lumiére brothers</span> are the inventors of the Cinématographe: a machine with an objective (lens) that imprints light onto film stock.
            <br>
            In <span class="name">Thomas A. Edison</span> made the kinetoscope <span class="date">(1889-1892)</span>. It was capable of reproducing moving film stock as well.
            <br class="short">
            The kinetoscope lost to the Cinématographe because commercially it was a worse product, more expensive, for a single user while the Cinématographe allowed for more people to watch together.
            <br class="short">
            Cinematography means "drawing the movement".
            <br>
            <span class="name">Eadweard Muybridge</span> <span class="date">(1870-1875)</span> was the first to capture animal movement on film.
            <br>
            In the following years there have been multiple machines that found other ways to solve the reproduction of a moving film stock, such as the Lanterna Magica and Mondo Nuovo.
            <br>
            Film stocks usually are 25mm but movies prefer a 35mm.
            <br>
            After the viewing of movies, the professor makes technical remarks on
            <ul>
                <li>
                    framing
                </li>
                <li>
                    geometry present in the shot
                <li>
                    geometry created by light
                </li>
                <li>
                    camera point of view
                </li>
                <li>
                    perspective
                </li>
                <li>
                    lines, shapes and the movement they create
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br class="short">
            In the beginning, films were captured at 16fps.
            <br class="short">
            Cinema, being born alongside colonialism, cooperated with propaganda and helped the idea of "powerful white, western man".
            <br>
            Soon enough there was the transition from the cinema of attraction <span class="date">(1895-1905)</span> to the cinema of narration <span class="date">(1905-1915)</span>.
            <br class="short">
            The first narrations were cautionary tales, made to raise public awareness of dangers and espressed in a simple structure made for simple people.
            <br class="short">
            One example of a simple structure is <i>Order &#8594; Transgression &#8594; Order</i>.
            <br>
            In <span class="date">1896</span> and <span class="date">1898</span> some films were starting to use editing.
            <br>
            <span class="name">David Wark Griffith</span> is considered to be the first american director.

            Assignment: Write a story about yourself.
            
            Movement. I don't do much of it, but to see it and to feel it is something I strife to learn to express.
            The music I listen to is dependant on rythm. Fast, slow, calculated and artistic. It is art in itself.
            Alongside an incredible soundscape I imagine a whole landscape that fits and narrartes the story that the sound is making me feel. It may contain some environmental storytelling but my preference is to leave a story to be, without forcing a narrative.
            The whole environment would feel like an abstract painting, a colorful one. And just like the painting , I would like to colour the scene as per my liking and feel of this rythm-driven story.


            Assignment: Create conflict in these situations:

            1) Paying an order at Mc Donald's
            The customer asked for a bag and was expecting better customer service instead of an additional charge for the bag
            2) Doing laundry
            Business as usual until the protagonist notices the power chord cut.
            3) At a family dinner
            The close family dinner ruined by the unexpected arrival of the self invited aunt.
            4) Preparing for a trip
            Everything's ready but dad still hasn't got the car tyres fixed.
            5) Feeding the pets
            The cat is missing and once found, the protagonist notices the cat killed mom's favourite bird in it's cage.

            In writing we care about showing what's important because the reader interprets and makes up a story that
            may be different from our initial intent.
            <br class="short">
            Dramaturgy and dramatic writing are not the artistic output but rather an intermediate piece for actors (for
            example) through which they will perform the final creative output.
            <br class="short">
            Conflict is interesting.
            <br class="short">
            The premise con conflict that's about to happen can create conflict or tension in the audience.
            <br class="short">
            The screenwriter can use conflict to reveal information on a character.
            <br class="short">
            The audience routes for the character with most conflict.
            <br class="short">
            The characters should be subjected to the most amount of conflict, because that's what the audience wants.
            <br class="short">
            Conflict not involving the protagonist won't affect the audience.
            <br class="short">
            Pauses between conflicts are needed but too long of a break will be boring to the audience.
            <br class="short">
            Referring to a character by name instead of their role will sell better the idea.

            On the 11 - 12 lessons total, the first 2 - 3 lessons will be about theory on camera and lighting.
            <br class="short">
            The other lessons will have applied theory but will involve more shooting.

            The professor is very loose with counting being late and absent. Late is after 20 minutes and absent is after 45
            minutes. <span class="info">Bless his soul.</span>

                Online platform accessible from onelogin. It is used to book and rent cinema equipment, like cameras, lenses, lights, cables, etc.
                <br class="short">
                The equipment is in the Media Lab, located in M -1.1.
                <br class="short">
                The Media Lab staff may ask for a project name and the professor's name.
                <br class="short">
                The only gear that can be rented is the one that we have discussed during the lessons. To access any other equipment we may ask the professor to plan a lesson on it.
                <br class="short">
                Damaging gear may result in an expense. Minor accidents usually pass but everything that happens must be reported to the Media Lab staff.

                called in to do it.

                No student is allowed to do it.

                We have 3 types of cones in the human eye: long, medium, short. They are L-Cones, M-Cones, and S-Cones respectively.
                <br>
                They capture light from the visible spectrum, and are distinguished based on the 3 bands of wavelengths they are most sensitive to. We distinguish between long, medium and short wavelengths, hence the cone names.
                <br>
                Short is blue, medium is green, and long is red.

                A camera sensor, for every 4 photosites, 1 is for the reds, 1 for the blues and 2 for the greens. The

                placement and order matters very little.

        <h2>Premise</h2>
        On the 11 - 12 lessons total, the first 2 - 3 lessons will be about theory on camera and lighting.
        <br>
        The other lessons will have applied theory but will involve more shooting.
        <br>
        The professor is very loose with counting being late and absent. Late is after 20 minutes and absent is after 45
        minutes. Bless his soul.
        <br>

        <h2>Booking platforms and usage</h2>
        <p>
            <span class="blue">CHEQROOM</span>
            Online platform accessible from onelogin. It is used to book and rent cinema equipment, like cameras,
            lenses,
            lights, cables, etc.
            <br>
            The equipment is in the Media Lab, located in M -1.1.
            <br>
            The Media Lab staff may ask for a project name and the professor's name.
            <br>
            The only gear that can be rented is the one that we have discussed during the lessons. To acquire any other
            equipment we may ask the professor to plan a lesson on it.

            Damaging gear may result in an expense. Minor incidents usually pass but everything that happens must be
            reported to the Media Lab staff.
        </p>
        <p>
            <br>
            <span class="blue">Skedda</span>
            Online platform accessible from onelogin. It is used to book the studios for any shooting.
            <br>
            If there is the need to hang anything from the studio ceiling, the Media Lab staff or a professor must be
            called
            in
            to do it. No student is allowed to do it. The staff assistance should be noted in the scheduling email.
        </p>

            We have 3 types of cones in the human eye: long, medium, short. Namely and respectively, they are the
            L-Cones,
            M-Cones, and S-Cones.
            <br>
            They capture light from the visible spectrum, and are distinguished based on the 3 bands of wavelengths they
            are
            most sensitive to. We coinceive of long, medium and short wavelengths, hence the cone names.
            <br>
            Short is blue, medium is green, and long is red.

            A camera sensor's aspect ratio usually is 3:2;
            <br>
            A camera sensor, for every 4 photosites, 1 is for the reds, 1 for the blues and 2 for the greens. The
            photosites
            placement and order matters very little.
            <br>
            Human eyes capture light at about 12 times per seconds;
            <br>
            the 180° rule: shoot at a shutter speed that is double the framerate. E.g. 25fps &#8594; 1/50s shutter
            speed.

        <h1>Exam</h1>

        The exam will be attended in the studio and is split in a theoretical and a practical part.
        <br>
        The final score is between 1 and 33. The score is the average between the practical and theoretical parts.
        <br>

        <h2>Practical exam</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Assignment is to shoot a little project that will be judged
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        on technical parameters such as camera movement, focus, lighting, framerate.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        on subjective judgement, such as the execution of the planned idea and the coherence of the
                        technical execution between the artistic choice and the story combined.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <u>NOT</u> on the post production quality, altough it could boost the score a little.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>

                    <li>
                        The project must be delievered before the exam date. Usually the submission date is the day
                        before
                        the exam.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Can be done in group or individually. Every member of the group will receive the same score (on the
                practical exam).
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Theoretical exam</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>

                33 multiple choice questions
            </li>
            <li title="-0 for every wrong answer? On multiple choice? In this economy? Sounds too, too good to be true">
                +1 for correct answer; -0 for wrong answer (<span class="yellow">verify</span>)
            </li>
            <li>
                Will be based on theory shared on Blackboard and some shared during the lessons
            </li>
        </ul>

        The professor will provide a sample of the exam somewhere in the future prior to the exam, obviously.
